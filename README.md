# Interesting projects:

the Thirsty Flamingo
This project monitors the moisture levels in the soil of your houseplant. If the soil crosses the threshold programmed as "dry", a piezo speaker emits a noise to notify you to re-water the plant. Once the plant's soil has reached an adequate moisture level, the sound will no longer play.

the Singing Plant
using a capacitance sensor, this project turns touch into sound. Depending on the kind of touch, different sounds will be emitted.

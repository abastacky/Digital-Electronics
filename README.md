### Interesting projects  

the Thirsty Flamingo:
This project monitors the moisture levels in the soil of your houseplant. If the soil crosses the threshold programmed as "dry", a piezo speaker emits a noise to notify you to re-water the plant. Once the plant's soil has reached an adequate moisture level, the sound will no longer play.

the Singing Plant:  
using a capacitance sensor, this project turns touch into sound. Depending on the kind of touch, different sounds will be emitted.

### Sensors

PIR (passive infrared radiation) Motion Sensor:
Senses motion within its range of detection by picking up on the subtle infrared radiation emitted by all living things. The sensor is split into two parts, in order to detect change in infrared radiation levels.

FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor):
Senses physical pressure, weight and squeezing. They are rarely accurate, but rather give ranges of data, with about a 10% margin of error. They are comprised of a semiconductor layer, an active element layer, and a spacer. Squeezing the layers together makes them touch, changing the sensor's resistive value.

Tilt sensor:
Enables the detection of orientation or incline. They are comprised of a hollow cavity with conductive poles on one end, and a conductive free mass inside. Orienting the sensor with the poles downwards allows the mass inside of it to touch the poles, shorting the circuit

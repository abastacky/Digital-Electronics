### Interesting projects  

the Thirsty Flamingo:
This project monitors the moisture levels in the soil of your houseplant. If the soil crosses the threshold programmed as "dry", a piezo speaker emits a noise to notify you to re-water the plant. Once the plant's soil has reached an adequate moisture level, the sound will no longer play.

the Singing Plant:  
using a capacitance sensor, this project turns touch into sound. Depending on the kind of touch, different sounds will be emitted.

### Sensors

PIR (passive infrared radiation) Motion Sensor:
Senses motion within its range of detection by picking up on the subtle infrared radiation emitted by all living things. The sensor is split into two parts, in order to detect change in infrared radiation levels.

FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor):
Senses physical pressure, weight and squeezing. They are rarely accurate, but rather give ranges of data, with about a 10% margin of error. They are comprised of a semiconductor layer, an active element layer, and a spacer. Squeezing the layers together makes them touch, changing the sensor's resistive value.

Tilt sensor:
Enables the detection of orientation or incline. They are comprised of a hollow cavity with conductive poles on one end, and a conductive free mass inside. Orienting the sensor with the poles downwards allows the mass inside of it to touch the poles, shorting the circuit

### Project Proposal: Teach Me How to Relate // Collective Body
A garment with Force Sensitive Resistors and/or heat sensors at strategic pressure points on the body. I'm conceiving of the garment as a shirt, with sensors embedded on the lower back, neck, crooks of elbows, and collar bone area. To be worn when getting to know someone new. The garment can be programmed with the wearer's specific touch preferences, and can be used to train others to relate to the wearer via touch. The garment will generate a noise denoting negative (or perhaps a red LED will light up) when a sensor corresponding to an off-limits or undesired area is touched. Sensors on neutral will not generate noise (or maybe they'll generate a tone denoting neutral, or cause a yellow LED to light up). The garment will generate a noise denoting positive (or cause a green LED to light up) when a sensor corresponding to an area of affinity is touched. For instance, some people don't like to be hugged: I'd put sensors at "hug" contact points on the body and program them to produce a "negative" response.

The garment is intended to encourage empathy, and highlight the emotional/dynamic/contextual quality of touch. It opens up the problematic that touch depends on context, and cannot simply be reduced to a definitive yes/no/neutral. This is a conversation piece, an instigator of debate, a medium for exploring the arena of touch with others.

Ideally there'd be a physical interface where users could program their own touch preferences in real time, so that the garment could respond to different users. I'm imagining a remote/keypad with switches or sliders.

Or perhaps each sensor is placed corresponding to specific stories or experiences, and touching one will cause a recording of that story to play. 

The program will:
-Read the amount of pressure or heat applied to a sensor
-Evaluate whether the sensor is associated with the positive, neutral, or negative category
-Light an LED based on the "desirability" of this particular quality of touch
-Play an audio clip/anecdote corresponding to the story

OR

-read the amount of pressure on the sensor
-evaluate how loud the audio should be played, based on pressure from the sensor
-play back recorded story/audio corresponding to that particular area on the body

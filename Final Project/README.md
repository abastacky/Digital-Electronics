# Wearable Therapy

## An interactive mat encouraging young pianists to engage in ulnar and radial deviation, a wrist physical therapy stretch intended to prevent arthritis and to develop suppleness of the wrist joint for optimal piano playing.



### Project goals: using capacitive touch, light, sound, and haptic feedback, develop a delightful interaction that motivates users to execute their physical therapy regimen. Feedback should be readily understandable, and help users understand where they are in the process of completing their exercises.
